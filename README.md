# MultithreadedIndexingAPI
Multithreaded Indexing API

<h4>Description</h4>
This project was built using Java 19+ and was intended to demonstrate a working knowledge of virtual threads, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, console UI, UML diagrams and creating JavaDocs. 

This project creates a word index from a text file with the dictionary definition and the page number the word appears on. The application uses virtual threads when parsing a text file. Googleâ€™s top 1000 words are excluded from the indexed file. 

<h4>Instructions</h4>
Follow the menu options in order to select a file to parse, configure the top 1000 words and dictionary, choose an output file name and, finally, create the indexed file. The indexed file will be created in the same directory the program is run from. 

<h4>Features</h4>
The Google top 1000 words is accurate as of December 2022.
Each word appears on one line
The words in the indexed file appear in A to Z alphabetical order.
The program has full JavaDoc details.
